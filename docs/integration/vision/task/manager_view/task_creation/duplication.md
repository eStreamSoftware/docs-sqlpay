# Duplication

Duplication allows managers to recreate a previously created task, including deleted missions, without needing to re-enter the mission details manually.

:::info[Note]

This feature is only available to **manager**.

## Mission Card

The mission card displays key details of the mission, including the Title, Created Date, Duration, and Members. Pressing the card allows you to create a new mission with the same details duplicated.

### Show only deleted mission

By default, the duplication page in SQL Vision displays only missions that have not been deleted. If you need to search for deleted missions, you can do so by using the filter function. The filter function allows you to specifically display missions that have been marked as deleted.
